# Water Prediction Model
Arsenic naturally occurs in groundwater sources around the world.
Arsenic contamination of groundwater affects millions of people around the world including the United States, Nicaragua, Argentina, China, Mexico, Chile, Bangladesh, India, and Vietnam, for example (Smith et al. 2000; Amini et al. 2008; Lin et al. 2017).
The World Health Organization (WHO 2018a) estimates that over 140 million people in 50 countries are exposed to arsenic contaminated drinking water above the WHO guideline of 10 $\mu$g/L.
Health effects of arsenic exposure include numerous types of cancer and other disorders.

This project follows an analysis of a public health study performed in rural Bangladesh (Gelman et al. 2004).
In this study, wells used for drinking water were analyzed for arsenic contamination and correspondingly labeled as safe or unsafe.
The study determined whether households switched the well used for drinking water and measured.
Additionally, several variables where measured that were thought to possibly influence the decision of whether or not to switch wells.
Here, we will investigate how accurately we can predict whether or not a household will switch wells based on these environmental variables.We hope that we could be able to pinpoint the exact reason as to what variable could influence households to switch wells to be able to improve the water quality of well and to hopefully influence households to switch to a healthier well.
